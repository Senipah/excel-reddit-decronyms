Returns the confidence interval for a population mean, using a normal distribution.
The confidence interval is a range of values. Your sample mean, x, is at the center of this range and the range is x ± CONFIDENCE. For example, if x is the sample mean of delivery times for products ordered through the mail, x ± CONFIDENCE is a range of population means. For any population mean, μ0, in this range, the probability of obtaining a sample mean further from μ0 than x is greater than alpha; for any population mean, μ0, not in this range, the probability of obtaining a sample mean further from μ0 than x is less than alpha. In other words, assume that we use x, standard_dev, and size to construct a two-tailed test at significance level alpha of the hypothesis that the population mean is μ0. Then we will not reject that hypothesis if μ0 is in the confidence interval and will reject that hypothesis if μ0 is not in the confidence interval. The confidence interval does not allow us to infer that there is probability 1 – alpha that our next package will take a delivery time that is in the confidence interval.

If Excel can’t resolve a formula you’re trying to create, you may get an error message like this one:  

Unfortunately, this means that Excel can’t understand what you’re trying to do, so you might just want to get out of here and start over.

Start by clicking OK or press ESC to close the error message.

You'll return to the cell with the broken formula, which will be in edit mode, and Excel will highlight the spot where it’s having a problem.  If you still don’t know what to do from there and want to start over, you can press ESC again, or click the Cancel button in the formula bar, which will exit you out of edit mode.



If you’re not sure what to do at this point or what kind of help you need, you can search for similar questions in the Excel Community Forum, or post one of your own.




If you want to move forward, then the following checklist provides troubleshooting steps to help you figure out what may have gone wrong in your formulas.

The LINEST function calculates the statistics for a line by using the ""least squares"" method to calculate a straight line that best fits your data, and then returns an array that describes the line. You can also combine LINEST with other functions to calculate the statistics for other types of models that are linear in the unknown parameters, including polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, and power series. Because this function returns an array of values, it must be entered as an array formula. Instructions follow the examples in this article.
The equation for the line is:
y = mx + b
–or–
y = m1x1 + m2x2 + ... + b
if there are multiple ranges of x-values, where the dependent y-values are a function of the independent x-values. The m-values are coefficients corresponding to each x-value, and b is a constant value. Note that y, x, and m can be vectors. The array that the LINEST function returns is {mn,mn-1,...,m1,b}. LINEST can also return additional regression statistics.

Use LOOKUP, one of the lookup and reference functions, when you need to look in a single row or column and find a value from the same position in a second row or column.
For example, let's say you know the part number for an auto part, but you don't know the price. You can use the LOOKUP function to return the price in cell H2 when you enter the auto part number in cell H1. 



Use the LOOKUP function to search one row or one column. In the above example, we're searching prices in column D. 
Use VLOOKUP to search one row or column, or to search multiple rows and columns (like a table). It's a much improved version of LOOKUP. Watch this video about how to use VLOOKUP.

For example, if the range A1:A3 contains the values 5, 25, and 38, then the formula =MATCH(25,A1:A3,0) returns the number 2, because 25 is the second item in the range.





Tip: Use MATCH instead of one of the LOOKUP functions when you need the position of an item in a range instead of the item itself. For example, you might use the MATCH function to provide a value for the row_num argument of the INDEX function.

If you're new to Excel, you'll soon find that it's more than just a grid in which you enter numbers in columns or rows. Sure, you can use Excel to find totals for a column or row of numbers, but you can also calculate a mortgage payment, solve math or engineering problems, or find a best case scenario based on variable numbers that you plug in. 
Excel does this by using formulas in cells. A formula performs calculations or other actions on the data in your worksheet. A formula always starts with an equal sign (=), which can be followed by numbers, math operators (like a +  or - sign for addition or subtraction), and built-in Excel functions, which can really expand the power of a formula.
For example, the following formula multiplies 2 by 3 and then adds 5 to that result to come up with the answer, 11.

=2*3+5

Here are some additional examples of formulas that you can enter in a worksheet.



=A1+A2+A3    Adds the values in cells A1, A2, and A3.



=SUM(A1:A10)    Uses the SUM function to return sum of the values in A1 through A10.



=TODAY()    Returns the current date.



=UPPER(""hello"")     Converts the text ""hello"" to ""HELLO"" by using the UPPER function.



=IF(A1&gt;0)    Uses the IF function to test the cell A1 to determine if it contains a value greater than 0.

The SEARCH and SEARCHB functions locate one text string within a second text string, and return the number of the starting position of the first text string from the first character of the second text string. For example, to find the position of the letter ""n"" in the word ""printer"", you can use the following function:
=SEARCH(""n"",""printer"")
This function returns 4 because ""n"" is the fourth character in the word ""printer.""
You can also search for words within other words. For example, the function
=SEARCH(""base"",""database"")
returns 5, because the word ""base"" begins at the fifth character of the word ""database"". You can use the SEARCH and SEARCHB functions to determine the location of a character or text string within another text string, and then use the MID and MIDB functions to return the text, or use the REPLACE and REPLACEB functions to change the text. These functions are demonstrated in Example 1 in this article.


Important: 


These functions may not be available in all languages.


SEARCHB counts 2 bytes per character only when a DBCS language is set as the default language. Otherwise SEARCHB behaves the same as SEARCH, counting 1 byte per character.



The languages that support DBCS include Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Korean.

This video is part of a training course called Add numbers in Excel 2013. 


Tips: 


If you want, you can apply the criteria to one range and sum the corresponding values in a different range. For example, the formula =SUMIF(B2:B5, ""John"", C2:C5) sums only the values in the range C2:C5, where the corresponding cells in the range B2:B5 equal ""John.""


To sum cells based on multiple criteria, see SUMIFS function.

TEXT,https://support.office.com/en-us/article/TEXT-function-20d5ac4d-7b94-49fd-bb38-93d29371225c,1,"**TEXT**:


Contributors:  



The TEXT function lets you change the way a number appears by applying formatting to it with format codes. It's useful in situations where you want to display numbers in a more readable format, or you want to combine numbers with text or symbols. 


Note: The TEXT function will convert numbers to text, which may make it difficult to reference in later calculations. It’s best to keep your original value in one cell, then use the TEXT function in another cell. Then, if you need to build other formulas, always reference the original value and not the TEXT function result.

TODAY,https://support.office.com/en-us/article/TODAY-function-5eb3078d-a82c-4736-8930-2f51a028fdd9,1,"**TODAY**:

Returns the serial number of the current date. The serial number is the date-time code used by Excel for date and time calculations. If the cell format was General before the function was entered, Excel changes the cell format to Date. If you want to view the serial number, you must change the cell format to General or Number.
The TODAY function is useful when you need to have the current date displayed on a worksheet, regardless of when you open the workbook. It is also useful for calculating intervals. For example, if you know that someone was born in 1963, you might use the following formula to find that person's age as of this year's birthday:

=
YEAR(
TODAY())-1963

This formula uses the TODAY function as an argument for the YEAR function to obtain the current year, and then subtracts 1963, returning the person's age.


Note: If the TODAY function does not update the date when you expect it to, you might need to change the settings that control when the workbook or worksheet recalculates. On the File tab, click Options, and then in the Formulas category under Calculation options, make sure that Automatic is selected.

Sometimes you need to switch or rotate cells. You can do this by copying, pasting, and using the Transpose option. But doing that creates duplicated data. If you don't want that, you can type a formula instead using the TRANSPOSE function. For example, in the following picture the formula =TRANSPOSE(A1:B4) takes the cells A1 through B4 and arranges them horizontally.




The key to getting TRANSPOSE to work: Make sure to press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER after typing the formula. If you've never entered this kind of formula before, the following steps will guide you through the process.

Important: The TRIM function was designed to trim the 7-bit ASCII space character (value 32) from text. In the Unicode character set, there is an additional space character called the nonbreaking space character that has a decimal value of 160. This character is commonly used in Web pages as the HTML entity, &amp;nbsp;. By itself, the TRIM function does not remove this nonbreaking space character. For an example of how to trim both space characters from text, see Remove spaces and nonprinting characters from text.

Use VLOOKUP, one of the lookup and reference functions, when you need to find things in a table or a range by row. For example, look up a price of an automotive part by the part number.
In its simplest form, the VLOOKUP function says:
=VLOOKUP(Value you want to look up, range where you want to lookup the value, the column number in the range containing the return value, Exact Match or Approximate Match – indicated as 0/FALSE or 1/TRUE).



This video is part of a training course called VLOOKUP: When and how to use it.


Tip: The secret to VLOOKUP is to organize your data so that the value you look up (part number) is to the left of the return value you want to find (price of the part).

CSE,https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Create-an-array-formula-e43e12e0-afc6-4a12-bc7f-48361075954d,1,"**CSE**:


Array formulas are powerful formulas that enable you to perform complex calculations that often can’t be done with standard worksheet functions. They are also referred to as ""Ctrl-Shift-Enter"" or ""CSE"" formulas, because you need to press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to enter them.  You can use array formulas to do the seemingly impossible, such as


Count the number of characters in a range of cells.


Sum numbers that meet certain conditions, such as the lowest values in a range or numbers that fall between an upper and lower boundary.


Sum every nth value in a range of values.


 
Excel provides two types of array formulas: Array formulas that perform several calculations to generate a single result and array formulas that calculate multiple results. Some worksheet functions return arrays of values, or require an array of values as an argument. For more information, see Guidelines and examples of array formulas.
