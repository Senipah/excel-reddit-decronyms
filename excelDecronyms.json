    "**FORMULA_OVERVIEW**:\n\n\n \nIf you're new to Excel, you'll soon find that it's more than just a grid in which you enter numbers in columns or rows. Sure, you can use Excel to find totals for a column or row of numbers, but you can also calculate a mortgage payment, solve math or engineering problems, or find a best case scenario based on variable numbers that you plug in. \nExcel does this by using formulas in cells. A formula performs calculations or other actions on the data in your worksheet. A formula always starts with an equal sign (=), which can be followed by numbers, math operators (like a +  or - sign for addition or subtraction), and built-in Excel functions, which can really expand the power of a formula.\nFor example, the following formula multiplies 2 by 3 and then adds 5 to that result to come up with the answer, 11.\n\n=2*3+5\n\nHere are some additional examples of formulas that you can enter in a worksheet.\n\n\n\n=A1+A2+A3    Adds the values in cells A1, A2, and A3.\n\n\n\n=SUM(A1:A10)    Uses the SUM function to return sum of the values in A1 through A10.\n\n\n\n=TODAY()    Returns the current date.\n\n\n\n=UPPER(\"hello\")     Converts the text \"hello\" to \"HELLO\" by using the UPPER function.\n\n\n\n=IF(A1&gt;0)    Uses the IF function to test the cell A1 to determine if it contains a value greater than 0.\n\n\n\n\n[Read more on Office Support.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Overview-of-formulas-in-Excel-ecfdc708-9162-49e8-b993-c311f47ca173)\n"
